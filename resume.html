  <h2>PROJECTS</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Infrared-Electroluminescence-UV Fluorescence Imaging of PV Modules :</strong>
    In our project, we employed UVF, electroluminescent, and infrared imaging on a 200W panel to detect PV module defects swiftly and affordably. In this analysis, we identified various micro defects in the panels that are responsible for power loss. These imaging techniques are useful for checking defects in a panel in a non-destructive manner.</li>
    <li><strong>Hotspot Testing of Photovoltaic Modules :</strong> In our experiment, we aimed to detect hotspots within the module, which are critical areas that could harm the entire module. Identifying these hotspots allows us to anticipate and prevent module failures under harsh conditions, ensuring durability and long-term performance. Additionally, we learned how to design panels to reduce the effect of hotspots by employing a bypass diode in series with the cells in the panel.</li>
    <li><strong>Performance Of Photovoltaic Modules :</strong> In this project, we studied the effect of radiation variation on the current and voltage of a mono-silicon panel. We discovered the true impact of irradiance changes on the IV curve and how the PV curve is affected by the cell's temperature.</li>
    <li><strong>PID Testing of Photovoltaic Modules : </strong> In this project, we aimed to assess the durability of a crystalline silicon photovoltaic module using a humidity and foil method. Potentially induced degradation (PID) is a power loss factor in silicon cells. Over time, it decreases the performance of panels. In this project, we studied this degradation to avoid it in panels by changing design materials to ensure long-term reliability.</li>
    <li><strong>Heat Recovery from Furnace Flue Gases : </strong>Developed a low-cost solution for improving furnace efficiency by recovering waste gas, directly relevant to focus on energy efficiency and performance improvement</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>PUBLICATION AND AWARD</h2>
  <ul>
