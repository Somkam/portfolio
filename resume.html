  <h2>PROJECTS</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Infrared-Electroluminescence-UV Fluorescence Imaging of PV Modules :</strong>
    In our project, we employed UVF, electroluminescent, and infrared imaging on a 200W panel to detect PV module defects swiftly and affordably. In this analysis, we identified various micro defects in the panels that are responsible for power loss. These imaging techniques are useful for checking defects in a panel in a non-destructive manner.</li>
    <li><strong>Hotspot Testing of Photovoltaic Modules :</strong> In our experiment, we aim to detect hotspots within the module, which are critical areas that could harm the entire module. Identifying these hotspots allows us to anticipate and prevent module failures under harsh conditions, ensuring its durability and long-term performance</li>
    <li><strong>Performance Of Photovoltaic Modules :</strong>We discovered the true impact of irradiance change on the IV curve from the experiment. Additionally, the PV curve is impacted by the cell's temperature</li>
    <li><strong>PID Testing of Photovoltaic Modules : </strong>This project aims to enhance the durability of crystalline silicon photovoltaic modules, focusing on mitigating potential-induced degradation (PID) through a humidity and foil method to improve long-term reliability</li>
    <li><strong>Heat Recovery from Furnace Flue Gases : </strong>Developed a low-cost solution for improving furnace efficiency by recovering waste gas, directly relevant to focus on energy efficiency and performance improvement</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>PUBLICATION AND AWARD</h2>
